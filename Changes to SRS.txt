1. Google Sign in removed from website interface. Google does not provide an address whereas we need the address of a restaurant, hence it doesn't make sense to use Google Sign in there.

2. vertical navbar of website moved to the left. could not manage to keep it in right side.

3. changed the way NFC is configured. Original plan did not include instructions.

4. "Add to cart" button added in restaurant menu, was missing in original design

5. Delete item added in wesite, was not part originally. Update made simpler for user convenience.
